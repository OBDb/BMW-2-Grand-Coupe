    description: "The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe is BMW's first compact four-door coupe, designed to compete with vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz CLA. Built on BMW's UKL2 front-wheel drive platform (shared with the F40 1 Series), it features a sleek, coupe-like roofline combined with four doors and a traditional trunk. Engine options range from a 1.5L three-cylinder in the 218i to a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder in the range-topping M235i xDrive, which produces 306 HP and features all-wheel drive. The interior adopts BMW's latest design language with digital instrumentation, a central touchscreen featuring BMW Operating System 7.0, and ambient lighting. Despite the front-wheel drive architecture, BMW focused on delivering engaging driving dynamics through sophisticated chassis tuning and technology including ARB (actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation) for improved traction control. The 2 Series Gran Coupe represents BMW's response to growing demand for style-focused compact premium sedans."
